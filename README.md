# Stuff

I'm wondering, what is the font that we're using?
Mononoki is the font we're using. It's a fork of Fira Code.

After installing and setting this with

    set guifont=*
    
I had to delete the nvim-data folder and reinstall
some plugins cache the font and don't update it when you change it
